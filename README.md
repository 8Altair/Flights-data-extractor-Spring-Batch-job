# Flights-data-extractor-Spring-Batch-job

This project is used for extracting useful information on current flights. It uses API that
holds the information from Flightradar 24 app. API is structured as JSON format, so the class
is made for saving information that we need as attributes, then it saves every flight data
in the object list.
It can also be used for writing that info in files or uploading it to some database.
